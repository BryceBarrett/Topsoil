Topsoil
=======

Topsoil is a desktop application and Java library that creates data
visualizations for geochronologists and other earth scientists. The project is
led and maintained by [CIRDLES](http://cirdles.org), an undergraduate research
lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.

The name "Topsoil" is an anagram of "Isoplot", the name of a now defunct
Microsoft Excel plugin that Topsoil is intended to replace.
